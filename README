This app is a bot for Bewjeweled Blitz on facebook. Some code (screen snapshot) is based on the sample app by Apple named OpenGLScreenSnapshot.

Usage:

- Open bejeweled blitz
- Select "Show Grid" on JewelBot. This will display a grid the same size as the game board.
- Start a new game in the web browser. 
- When the game starts, select the JewelBot window. Then use the buttons or your arrow keys to move the grid.
  Holding Shift moves it faster.
  Line up so that the green boxes are in the center of the game board. Once it is lined up, select "Hide Grid"
- Wait for the game in progress to finish. 
- Start a new game. When you see 'Go' start to disappear, click the "Make Move" button or hit cmd-opt-a to start the bot
- The bot will then run for 63 seconds. It will take control of the mouse during this time.

Tuning:

There are three inputs at the bottom for tuning. The game calculates reads the board and will then execute up to "Swaps" moves in a turn. At the end of the turn it will then wait for the board to stabilize up to 5 * "Delay". Finally, "Turbo" is how long until the delay is removed. Set this too soon and the bot may thrash making moves, as well as your system may slow down.

Tuning warnings:
- Don't set swaps more than 100.
- Setting delay less than 2 may make the game thrash deciding moves and slow your system down
- Setting turbo to lower than 30 will cause the bot to make moves very fast and slow your system down. Faster != higher score.
